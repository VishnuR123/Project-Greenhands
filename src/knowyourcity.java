The following document therefore focuses on the strategy, processes and tools essentially for enabling the conservation of this Marsh.\n" +
"\n" +
"Wetlands are the most important of life-supporting ecosystems that have sustained human lives and communities over the millennia.  They are defined as ‘lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by standing water that does not exceed 6 meters’.  Evidently, this seemingly generic definition facilitates the inclusion of a large gamut of habitats ranging from mangroves to peats and bogs.  This diversity while contributing to the enormous diversity of wetland organisms is also a significant impediment in evolving overall management strategies and plans.  Further, wetlands in view of their transitional nature need to be managed with caution since the probability of losing their ecological structure and integrity through a process called ecological flip is rather high.  Wetlands are therefore ideally managed using a decentralized framework of management; with locale specific management processes and tools.\n" +
"\n" +
"A large part of south Chennai was historically a flood plain as evidenced by the soil type of the region, which is described as recent alluvium and granite gneiss. Spread over 50 sq. km, it comprised of a large Marsh (Pallikaranai Marsh), smaller satellite wetlands, large tracts of pasture land and patches of dry forests.  The composite nature of the landscape wherein the entire landscape is defined as a coastal plain with intermittent and overlapping habitat types of cultivation, wetlands and scrub forests.\n" +
"\n" +
"Locally known as Kazhiveli (a generic Tamil name for Marshes and swamps), the  Pallikaranai Marsh drained about 250 sq. km, through two outlets viz. the Okkiyam Madavu (channel) in Okkiyam thuraipakkam and the Kovalam Creek.  It is imperative that the phrase ‘draining’ is to be understood in the context of flood mitigation, ground water recharge and irrigation.  It is not to be deciphered as a one shot flushing of water.  Remnant forests can be observed within the Theosophical Society campus, Guindy National Park-IIT complex and the Nandamangalam Reserve Forest.");

The 42.5-kilometre (26.4 mi) long river contributes to the estuarine ecosystem of Chennai. Despite the high pollution levels, boating and fishing take place in this river. The river collects surplus water from about 200 tanks and lakes, small streams and the rainwater drains in the city, with a combined catchment area of 860 square kilometres (331 sq mi). Most of the waste from the city is drained into this river and the Cooum.Adyar river starts from Malaipattu tank (80.00° latitude and 12.93° longitude) near Manimangalam village in Sriperumbudur Taluk at about 15 kilometres (9 mi) west of Tambaram near Chennai. It starts to appear as a stream only from the point where water from Chembarambakkam lake joins the river. It flows through Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chennai district for about 42.5 kilometres (26.4 mi) before joining the Bay of Bengal in Adyar, Chennai.[1][2] Here it forms an estuary, which extends from the Adyar Bridge to the sandbar at the edge of the sea, with some small islets in-between. The estuary attracts a wide variety of birds. The estuary covering an area of about 120 hectares (300 acres) was made a protected wildlife reserve in 1987.[3] The river forms a backwater near the mouth, known as the Adyar creek, due to the formation of sand bar at the mouth. This creek is a natural channel which carries tidal water back into the sea.he river has varying depth of approximately 0.75 metres (2.5 ft) in its upper reaches and 0.5 metres (1.6 ft) in its lower reaches. The catchment area of the river is 530 square kilometres (200 sq mi). Bed width ranges from 10.5 to 200 metres (34 to 656 ft). It flows for 24 kilometres (15 mi) in the Chennai Metropolitan Area including about 15 kilometres (9 mi) within the Chennai District before draining into the sea.[4] It discharges about 190 to 940 million cubic metres (150,000 to 760,000 acre⋅ft) water annually to the Bay of Bengal. The discharge is seasonal with about 7 to 33 times more than the annual average during the North East monsoon season between September to December. The river is also supplied by surplus water from about 40 ponds.");

"Kosasthalaiyar is 136-kilometre (85 mi) long and originates near Pallipattu in Thiruvallur district and drains into the Bay of Bengal. Its northern tributary Nagari river originates in Chitoor district of Andhra Pradesh and joins the main river in the backwaters of Poondi reservoir. Its catchment area is spread over Vellore, Chitoor, North Arcot, Thiruvallur and Chennai districts. It has a catchment area in North Arcot District where it branches near Kesavaram Anicut and this tributary flows to the Chennai city as Cooum River, while the main river flows to the Poondi reservoir. From Poondi reservoir, the river flows through Thiruvallur District, enters the Chennai metropolitan area, and joins the sea at Ennore creek. The river has 9 check dams. There are two check dams across the river at Tamaraipakkam and Vallur.[1] The excess discharge in the river is controlled by the Tamarapakkam Anicut[2] located across the river in the downstream of Poondi reservoir. Vallur Anicut is a small check dam constructed near Minjur across the river to control water levels and feed irrigation channels in the area. It flows to a distance of 16 kilometres (10 mi) in the Chennai metropolitan area. The total catchment area of the river is 3,757 kilometres (2,334 mi), and the bed width ranges from 150 to 250 metres (490 to 820 ft). The discharge capacity of the river is 110,000 cubic metres per second (3,900,000 cu ft/s), and the anticipated flood discharge capacity is about 125,000 cubic metres per second (4,400,000 cu ft/s).[3] The river drains up to 50,000 cubic feet per second (1,400 m3/s) of flood water into the sea through the Ennore creek during monsoons.[4]\n" +
"\n" +
"Galeru Nagari irrigation project is under execution to supply Krishna river water from Srisailam reservoir in Nagari basin of Chitoor district.\n" +
"\n" +
"Every year, whenever the floodgates of Poondi reservoir are opened, a considerable volume of water gets drained into the sea through the Kosasthalaiyar river near the Ennore creek.\n" +
"\n" +
"Work on 10th check dam across the river is expected to by completed by the end of 2018 at a cost of ₹ 70 million. The structure would be 1.5 meters high, built across the 100-meter wide river. It would store water in the river for over 2 kilometers.[5]\n" +
"\n" +
"Channels\n" +
"The historic Korattur anicut located at Jamin Korattur in Tiruvallur district serves as a vital channel to regulating water to the Chembarambakkam reservoir. The dam was built in 1876 across the unpolluted stretch of the Cooum river and diverts excess water to the Chembarambakkam reservoir.");

This river is about 72 km in length, flowing 32 km in the Urban part and the rest in rural part. The river is highly polluted in the urban area (Chennai). Along with the Adyar River running parallel to the south, the river trifurcates the city and separates Northern Chennai from Central Chennai.\n" +
"\n" +
"Its source is in a place by the 'kesavaram anaicut built across Kallar river in Vellore district adjoining Chennai district. From its origin in the kesavaram Village to Paruthipattu Anaikat, the river remains unpolluted. Beyond this, the river is highly polluted till its mouth in the Bay of Bengal.[1] In Chennai district, the river flows through three corporation zones—Kilpauk, Nungambakkam and Triplicane—for a total length of 16 kilometres (10 mi).[2]\n" +
"\n" +
"Owing to intensive use of surface water upstream for agriculture, indiscriminate pumping of groundwater leading to reduced base flow in the river, formation of sand bar at the mouth of the river, discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluents and encroachment along the banks, the river, especially the downstream, has been highly polluted.[1] In 2018 alone, about 21,665 tonnes of waste was removed from the river.Flora and fauna\n" +
"According to scientists, around 1950, Cooum had 49 species of fish,[4] and by the late 1970s, this was reduced to 21 species.[12] However, on date, there are no fish in the river, owing to highly toxic pollutants found in the river water.\n" +
"\n" +
"Pollution\n" +
"The river is narrow, placid, slow and meandering. The river is primarily fed by discharge from tank and water bodies and has seen a steady drop in freshwater over the years, a primary reason for its present-day condition.[13] However, the core problem of the Cooum has been that due to the sand bar, the river mouth near the Napier Bridge gets blocked for most of the time, preventing the river water from draining into the sea. This has, eventually, made the river, in its 18-km-long stretch in the central district, a stinking cesspool.[12]\n" +
"\n" +
"Tests of water samples reveals almost zero dissolved oxygen and substantial presence of faecal coliform bacteria, besides heavy metals such as lead, zinc and cadmium.[9]\n" +
"\n" +
"The study of the river was undertaken as part of a World Bank-funded project and shows that it is 80 percent more polluted than treated sewer. Fish were able to survive in the water for only 3 to 5 hours even after samples were diluted. There are traces of heavy metals like copper and pesticides like endosulphan and lindane in it. Public Works Department sources said government agencies like Chennai Corporation and business units and retail outlets on the banks of the river were responsible for the pollution. The water has almost no dissolved oxygen, and instead there are traces of heavy metals like copper, besides sewage and sludge. Due to its narrowness and about 3,500 illegal hutments along its banks, it has not been recently desilted, which has closed it to river traffic. Per 2003 enumeration, about 9,000 families live along the river, in addition to 450 shops and commercial buildings.[12] There are 700-odd points in the river bank where sewage flows straight into the river.[13] There are 127 identified sewage outfalls into the river, out of which 85 are in use.");

Since Velachery is a low-lying area, the monsoon rain water from the neighbouring areas are drained into this lake. CHENNAI: In an unexpected turn of events, the Chennai Corporation has decided to put on hold the proposal for boat rides and other tourist facilities on the Velachery lake, one of the few water bodies still alive in the city. The reason it has cited is the high level of contamination of the water.\n" +

"The ambitious programme of the corporation was conceived three years ago. The local body had even engaged a consultant, shortlisted by experts from Anna University, Public Works Department and the agriculture department. The consultant gave a detailed plan in October last on how to beautify the lake. This included removal of encroachments in Gandhi Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar, fencing of the entire waterbody, provision of three decks for walking, viewing and fishing and a boating jetty. The consultant also suggested plantation of African grass, reed and bamboo along the middle deck and flowering plants and trees like bottlebrush, bougainvillea, royal palms and areca nut betel palms along the upper deck.\n" +

Plenty of representations were made to the departments concerned to maintain the lake, but in vain,\" said A Ramasamy of Federation of Velachery Welfare Associations and a resident of Lakshmi Hayagriva Nagar.\n" +
"\n" +
"Had the lake been properly maintained, it could have been a major source of drinking water. The rapid pace of real estate development in the last two decades resulted in the shrinking of the waterbody from 265 acres to 55 acres now.
